# Tensor_Networks_demo
A more public demonstration section of my work with tensor networks.

9_q_MPS_main.py, 8qubit_main.py and 4_qubit_main.py are the main executables with the rest as data or utility functions (including a VERY large set of functions defining all manner of quantum gates and circuits).
